        <h3 class="h3-middle-work">IBM Malaysia - AIX System Adminstrator</h3>
        <p class="p-middle-work">I have been working as an AIX System Administrator for 1 year in IBM. My job was to resolve customer problems with their servers, replace the fault parts and solve any OS issue.
          With a good effort, I have been tasked and assigned as an Assistant for the “Preventive Maintenance Process”. I conducted systems and servers checking, documentation and resolved at least 95 percent of the customer problems. I know how to resolve customer problems in a
          quick manner where most of the customers are satisfied with the results. Besides that, I went for many onsite activities for IBM clients (Government, Banking Sectors and etc). While being onsite, I enjoyed interacting with customers, improving the customer-company
          relationship and solving customer request. While I was working in IBM,  I have also received some appreciation from my seniors and from some customers during my onsite activities. </p>

        <h3 class="h3-middle-work">P&M Travel Technology (Internship & Part Time) - Assistant  Developer</h3>
        <p class="p-middle-work">I have worked in P&M Travel Technology during in my Internship and as my part time job. One of my reponsibility is to maintain the company websites, design and affiliate platform with based solution. Some clients requested us to design a travel website for them. I have also edited and design the company few own travel websites.
          Bookingee.com is designed by P&M Empire Group and it is an online travel booking system which allows travel agencies/ tour operators to do their booking. I was placed in charged of the mapping for the hotels and destinations for each country. My task is to monitor the mapping details of hotels and destinations and update them into the Bookingee.com by using Excel sheets.
          It was difficult for me because the task consumes plenty of time and it was tough to maintain a lot of countries data. In the end, with good time management and organizing my work well, I have overcome this problem. There was another issue which I faced which is language barrier. It was tough for me to understand my colleage most of the time because they are communicating in their own native language but thankfully they understand my situation and communicate with me in English whenever I am in the office. </p>
